Initial release:
-- There is still some cleanup of the code that can be done and a minor bug where occasionally there is a small glitch in the motion object as a ship hits the edge of the screen. I am not abslutely certain at this time that this is specific to the FPGA version and not a bug in the original hardware or code. 

# ROMs
```
                                *** Attention ***

ROMs are not included. In order to use this arcade, you need to provide the

To simplify the process .mra files are provided in the releases folder, that
specifies the required ROMs with checksums. The ROMs .zip filename refers to the
corresponding file of the M.A.M.E. project.
